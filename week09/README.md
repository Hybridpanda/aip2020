# Notes

This directory contains a simple sample solution to the version challenge in the labs and workbook.

The same principles could be applied in a React/Angular project or any application.

Other ideas suggested:

- Use the complete value of text as the "version", rather than a version number
- Use a hash of the text, rather than a version number
- Have users "lock" the document before editing (this could be a bad user experience)
- Keep a history of every change (so that versioning may not be needed at all)
- Keep the document continuously synchronized, similar to Google Docs (you could use a synchronization framework to help you with this)
- Use a database, perhaps using Mongoose/Sequelize to look after versioning
